## Description

This project was made in a Mid-level Frontend Developer application on September 2023.

The goal was to implement and enhance a previously existing search component, by showing some dynamically-rendered suggestions before submitting the query string and apply local filters on data requested via Google Books API. In addition, I've improved the layout and adjusted home and search screen by applying mobile-first design approaches.
